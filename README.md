A monorepository of various projects of mine related to The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth.

## Testament

*Technically* a fork of Lua 5.3.3 (the version used by TBoI:R), Testament is a simple mod loader for Repentance which extends upon the pre-existing Lua API and hosts an instance of the CLR that enables .NET modding support.

## Installing

You may have found yourself here from the workshop page or in-game from a big scary warning (or you came across this repository organically).

Installing Testament is a very simple drag-n-drop once you extract the latest archive from the releases page.

1. Go to [Releases](https://github.com/steviegt6/isaac/releases).
2. Download the latest `testament.zip` archive.
3. Extract it into the root game directory (most commonly `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\The Binding of Isaac Rebirth`).
4. Start TBoI:R as normal.

## Building
