A monorepository of various projects of mine related to The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth.

## Testament

> **Warning** | If you're here for **Testament**, go to [Installing Testament](#installing).

_Technically_ a fork of Lua 5.3.3 (the version used by TBoI:R), Testament is a simple mod loader for Repentance which extends upon the pre-existing Lua API and hosts an instance of the CLR that enables .NET modding support.

### Installing

#### This is the one players care about. Read here!

You may have found yourself here through various means:

- you came across this repository organically,
- you were linked to this repository through the Steam Workshop,
- you were linked to this repository from a massive, scary warning in-game after not listening,
- or you were linked to this repository manually by a user who is likely tired of linking to this repository.

Whatever the reason, this what you're here for. Testament is very simple to install.

1. Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/steviegt6/isaac/releases) page.
2. Download the latest `testament.zip` archive.
3. Extract it into the root game directory (most commonly `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\The Binding of Isaac Rebirth`).
4. Start TBoI:R as normal.

You'll know Testament installed correctly if a console window opens up alongside the game (as well as if the big scary in-game warning goes away).
